A few highlights about the code that most people won't give a rat's about or even understand:
 Shared object file integration
 100% rewritten fightcode
 'Modular' classes; easy to add, modify, or remove a class
 Central class functions to handle hr, dr, ac, parry, dodge, attacks, etc
 Easially expanded SQL integration; currently powering the social table
  ^^^^^NOTE: You WILL need to either figure out the SQL code or remove it to even BOOT the mud
 A configure command to change many in-game parameters and other such junk
 Lots of other crap I don't feel like thinking of =)

This code was released 04.01.03 (yes, April Fools Day, but this is no joke)...Blah blah blah.
Anyhow, if you want to be able to actually boot the mud, you need to do a few key things.

1) Either remove the SQL code, or link it into your own database to use
2) READ THE MAKEFILE, you NEED to "make so" and compile the shared object files
3) No being stupid.  Durgh.

If all else fails, and we're feeling nice, we might offer you some help.
Come visit us at SWOOH.COM on port 7181.  Either drop a note to imm, Kale, or Kline;
or try to catch one of us online.  Leave an email address if you really want a response,
since we might not see each other on the mud very frequently =).

And above all else, ENJOY OUR WORK.
Oh, and read help vortex.
